    <p>
      Juliana is a graduate of the University of Washington’s School of Aquatic
      and Fishery Sciences. She completed her master’s thesis in 2014 on the
      relationship between vessel traffic and the noise levels received by
      killer whales. She and her collaborators aimed to figure out what whales
      actually experience at depth by attaching digital acoustic recording tags
      (Dtags) to them with suction cups. She found that vessel speed was the
      most important contributor to noise levels received by whales (Houghton et
      al. 2015). Juliana hopes her findings will allow more boat-based
      whale-watchers to be as respectful of the whales as possible. For more

Her undergraduate work focused on the effects of the aquarium trade on the Southern Resident killer whale population, whereas her masters work investigated the similarities and differences in the rare cooperative fisheries that have existed and exist throughout the world between humans and five cetacean species. Kailey currently lives in Friday Harbor, WA, with her husband, two kids, two cats, and two dogs. When she is not involved in marine mammal work she can be found in ballet class (she’s danced many forms of dance since a little girl), enjoying the outdoors, and spending time with friends and family.',

  'Ariel is originally from eastern South Dakota but has always had the Pacific Northwest in her heart.  She first fell in love with our Southern Resident Killer Whales at the age of two when J1 Ruffles and J2 Granny appeared in the opening sequence of the movie Free Willy. Between her junior and senior year of college, Ariel got her first taste of the PNW when she worked at a summer camp on Orcas Island, WA, in 2012. She moved to Lynnwood, WA, in fall 2013 and began working as a registered nurse on the organ transplant unit at Swedish Hospital in downtown Seattle. She completed the Marine Naturalist Training Program in the fall of 2015 and has since spent hundreds of hours on the shores of the Salish Sea educating the public about our killer whales. In the summertime, Ariel can most often be found wandering the trails of American Camp, San Juan Island. Her favorite activity involves dragging her friends and family on camping trips to the San Juan’s to see the whales. Ariel also loves kayaking (if you meet her be sure to ask about her folding kayak), photography, and considers herself to be a movie buff. You can bet that so long as the activity has something to do with whales or the sea, Ariel loves it. After all, what do you expect from a mermaid?',

Now retired, after a 37 year teaching career, Laurie focuses her energy on helping the Southern Resident Killer Whales in any way possible. She’s been with Whale Scout since 2014, is a Forest Steward at Idylwood Park, and a water quality monitor for SnoKing Watershed Council. Laurie also volunteers on the Soundwatch Education boat, sponsored by The Whale Museum. Laurie believes that education is KEY to helping the whales and jumps at the chance to talk with kids as well as adults about what they can do to help. She also loves organizing restoration work parties along salmon spawning streams and field trips to the Elwha River.',
